# First python program from scratch.
print("Hello World!!")
print(18)
print("Hello Dhrubajit Chakravarty")
# or you can use it this way
print("Hello World!!", 18, "Dhrubajit Chakravarty")
# This shall print the same value , but just have made its presentation much easier by imposing it one line.
# So, this is the way we will code more programs using python.
